2d simulated terrarium

- bees which build hives, gather nectar and lay eggs which become more bees
- beetles which steal nectar and eggs and die if there are no 'air' tiles around
them (to simulate being cooked by bees or pulled apart by ants)
- ants which dig tunnels, eat beetles and nectar and lay eggs
- the user can add elements (creatures, substrate, etc.) and change environmental conditions (heat, light, humidity, etc.)

tile types I'll need:
- substrate (soil making up the ground)
- hive (made by bees using nectar)
- plant stem (grows flowers and stem if near water)
- flower (produces nectar and spreads seeds if bees interact with it)
- water (needed by plants)
- air (fills all empty space, beetles need it to live)
- egg (bee and ant variants, eaten by beetles, otherwise become bees or ants)
- honey (stored form of nectar, eaten by bees, ants and beetles)
- insect food (can be placed by the user)
- bee 
- ant
- beetle
- snail (occasionally appears to eat plant stem and flowers, can be eaten by ants)


winforms will be used, a grid of boxes will display data stored in an array 
representing the tiles within the terrarium
